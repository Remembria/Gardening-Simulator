# Gardening Simulator
## Caring for virtual plants with virtual consequences

The goal of this application is twofold as follows:
- **To create** a gardening simulator for botany-enjoyers to garden without the stress of *real-world error*
- **To model** the growth of plants mathematically

Given these specifications, the target audience of this project will likely be: 
1. **Beginners** who are interested in getting into gardening
2. **Intermediate/Advanced** plant-enthusiasts who already take care of houseplants
3. **Game players** who enjoy idle genres that involve slow, relaxed gameplay

Personally, my own rationale for this project falls under all categories: I've always been interested in houseplants â€“ 
but I'm a horrible plant-parent (*mine always die*), and so I usually stick to the tenacious but unimpressive cacti and 
succulents. Seeing as virtual plants can't really *die*, I saw the opportunity to practice my gardening skills in a Java 
environment as an enjoyable way to pass time and improve my mindfulness in regards to taking care of plants. What's 
more, I've already had an interest in **Lindenmayer systems**, which use formal grammar to create beautiful, 
fractal-esque drawings that mimic natural growth. By pursuing this project, I therefore hope to gain a better 
understanding of mathematical **L-systems** through their application within a programming environment.
